 * \section Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the libfilezilla documentation.
 *
 * libfilezilla is a small and modern C++ library, offering some basic functionality to build high-performing, platform-independent programs. Some of the highlights include:
 *
 * \li A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet extremely efficient
 * \li Timers for periodic events
 * \li A \ref fz::datetime "datetime" class that not only tracks timestamp but also their accuracy, which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources
 * \li Simple \ref fz::process "process" handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O
 *
 * libfilezilla works on most modern platforms that have a C++14 compiler, including, but not limited to, Linux, *BSD, OS X and Windows.
